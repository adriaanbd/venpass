# Venpass

This program is evaluates a given password's strength.

The requirements were laid out by a Panamanian company in an effort to measure software development skills using Ruby.

## Getting Started

```
$ git clone git@github.com:adriaanbd/venpass.git
$ cd venpass

$ ruby main.rb
```

The script will ask you to enter your password and respond with your password strength. If the password is weak, it will give you an updated version of your password to classify as strong. If the password is unacceptable, you'll have to run the script again with a new password.
